High-availability-webserver
A minimal high-availability web server architecture typically consists of multiple components distributed across redundant infrastructure to ensure continuous availability and reliability. Here's an overview of such an architecture along with mechanisms to handle infrastructure failures:

1. **Load Balancer**: 
   - At the front end, there's a load balancer responsible for distributing incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure even load distribution and prevent any single server from being overwhelmed.
   - Mechanism: Load balancers are configured with health checks to monitor the health of backend servers. If a server fails or becomes unresponsive, the load balancer automatically reroutes traffic to healthy servers.

2. **Web Servers**:
   - Behind the load balancer are multiple web servers hosting the web application or serving static content. These servers are identical and serve the same content.
   - Mechanism: A load balancer distributes traffic evenly across these web servers. In case of a server failure, the load balancer detects it through health checks and routes traffic only to healthy servers.

3. **Database Servers (Optional)**:
   - For dynamic websites or applications that require data storage, there might be a database server or a cluster of database servers.
   - Mechanism: Similar to web servers, database servers can be set up in a clustered configuration with mechanisms like master-slave replication or multi-master replication. If one database server fails, the others can continue serving requests.

4. **Replication and Redundancy**:
   - To ensure high availability, all components should be replicated across multiple availability zones or data centers.
   - Mechanism: Using technologies like Kubernetes for container orchestration or tools like AWS Auto Scaling Groups, replicas of web servers and databases are automatically created and distributed across multiple availability zones. This ensures that even if one zone goes down, the system remains operational.

5. **Monitoring and Alerting**:
   - Continuous monitoring of server health, performance metrics, and availability is essential for detecting and responding to failures promptly.
   - Mechanism: Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or AWS CloudWatch can be used to monitor various metrics and set up alerts. Automated alerts can notify administrators or trigger automated failover processes in case of anomalies or failures.

6. **Automated Failover**:
   - Automated failover mechanisms ensure that in the event of a failure, the system can quickly and automatically switch over to redundant components without manual intervention.
   - Mechanism: For example, in AWS, Route 53 can be configured with health checks to monitor the health of endpoints (e.g., web servers) and automatically route traffic away from unhealthy endpoints to healthy ones.

7. **Regular Backups**:
   - Regular backups of data are crucial for data recovery and disaster recovery.
   - Mechanism: Automated backup solutions can periodically back up data to remote locations or redundant storage systems. In case of data loss or corruption, the system can be restored from backups.

By implementing these components and mechanisms, a minimal high-availability web server architecture can effectively handle infrastructure failures, ensuring continuous availability and reliability for users.
